Darknet is an open source neural network framework written in C and CUDA. It is fast, easy to install, and supports CPU and GPU computation.

For more information see the [Darknet project website](http://pjreddie.com/darknet).

We just have the compiled binary of darknet and the python wrapper in here.

To modify the compiled darknet library or recompile, clone the repo from [here](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet) and run `make` in the terminal. You may want to change the flags at the top of the file to do things like use GPUs, etc.
