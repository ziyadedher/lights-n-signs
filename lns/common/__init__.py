"""Shared lights and signs base code.

This package contains all code that is common or shared between different
packages for lights and signs training. It includes, but is not limited to,
common data downloading and preprocessing into standardized formats, generic
model interfaces, and general model training.

This is not a standalone package, it is useless for anything except preparation
for different algorithms for prediction.
